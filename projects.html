<p id="paragraphs">A controller offers a level of abstraction between an operating system (OS) and the physical drives. A RAID controller presents groups of or sections of drives to applications and OSes as logical units for which data protection schemes can be defined. The logical units appear as drives -- or portions of drives -- to the applications and OSes, even though they may comprise parts of multiple drives. Because the controller has the ability to access multiple copies of data on multiple physical devices, it has the ability to improve performance and protect data in the event of a system crash.</p>

<p id="paragraphs">In addition to being faster, SSDs are more durable because they don't have moving parts that can be broken or worn out. They also use less energy, saving battery life on portable devices like laptops. These are just a few examples of great SSD benefits, but there are several reasons why you should upgrade to an SSD. External SSDs -  also known as portable SSDs â€“ are solid state hard drives that can be swapped out without the need to open up your computer. They are made to be used with multiple systems and devices, including desktop PCs, laptops, Macs, iPads, Chromebooks, Android mobile devices and iPhones.</p>
